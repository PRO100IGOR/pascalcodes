How to add translation for CnWizards?
-------------------------------------
CnWizards supports multi-language UI. If you want to add new translation
for CnWizards, please do follow steps:

1.You can get all language files from our SVN or download page.
* How to access our SVN: 
http://code.google.com/p/cnpack/source/checkout
* Or you can download CnWizards source code from here(Maybe not latest): 
http://code.google.com/p/cnpack/downloads/list

2.Our language files are in cnwizards\Bin\Lang, 1033 is English.
Also the Lang directory is in our installation destination, such as 
C:\Program Files\CnPack\CnWizards\Lang

3.For a new language, such as French, you can copy 1033(English) directory
to 1036(French) and translate all the txt files in it into French.

4.For example, if there's a line in CnWizards.txt
TCnWizAboutForm.Caption=About CnPack IDE Wizards
You can translate it as:
TCnWizAboutForm.Caption=(French string)

5.You can edit follow basic information in every new language file. Such as:
!LanguageID=1036
!LanguageName=French
!TranslationAuthor=Your Name
!TranslationAuthorEmail=Your email

6.You can copy new language directory to Lang directory in CnWizards 
installation destination. So you can see and select the new language in IDE.

7.You need to translate follow files to new language for CnWizards installer:
cnwizards\License.enu.txt
cnwizards\Readme.enu.txt
cnwizards\Install\Src\Lang\CnWizInst_enu.nsh

8.When you finished, please mail them to master@cnpack.org. You'll see the
new language in CnWizards and your name in our credits in next build .
